### Learning Outcome ### 

I used Github heavily for my capstone, so I feel decently familiar with it. With this assignment, I learned about that cool
little readme to make a bio on your page. Otherwise, this cemented in my memory the things that I learned in capstone 
about how to use Github, so I'm feeling decently comfortable!
